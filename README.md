# MNIST
In this small project I've applied the knowledge that I learned in [Kaggle's Computer Vision Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision)
<br>
Notes:
<br>
- The current implementation's accuracy range is [98.8%, 99.05%]
<br>
- Improvements require further analysis on ambiguous data
